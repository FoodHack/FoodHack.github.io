          <h1 class="recipe-headings">Swedish Lamb Shanks with Jansson's Temptation</h1>
            <p> This was the first dish I cooked from the first cookbook I was given by my mum. It's a Cajun dish that uses 'the holy trinity' of onion, garlic and celery with andouille sausage and chicken or shrimp. Andouille sausage can be tricky to get if you're not in the United States, so chorizo is a good substitute. Authentic Jambalaya calls for Cajun spices to be added during the process but chorizo has a some of the same herbs and spices added before curing. The quality of chorizo is crucial to the flavour of this dish. I use a semi-cured as the sausage stays more tender but fully cured is good as well - see <a href="#" id="produce-link">favourite produce</a> if you're in Sydney. It's a  great one-pot dish for beginners because you can do most of the prep in advance and then add the ingredients one at a time. My advice to beginners is to have lots of bowls with each of the ingredients in them based on when they get added.</p>

                <br>
                  The blackberry and spice in this wine will still come through against the richness of these dishes. It's an absolute bargain at $20.

              <h3 class="recipe-headings">Directions</h3>
              <p>Heat a knob of butter and 1 tbsp oil in a large flameproof casserole dish over a high heat. Season the lamb shanks and cook in batches until browned all over.
              <br>
              <br>
              Remove the shanks to a plate. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion and cook for 10 minutes or until lightly golden. Add the garlic, anchovies and peppercorns and cook for 1 minute. Carefully stir in the brandy and vinegar, scraping up any cooked-on bits.
              <br>
              <br>
              Next add the stock, molasses, allspice, bay leaf and 375 ml water, stirring to combine. Return the lamb shanks to the dish, making sure the meaty part is submerged in the liquid.Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours, or until the meat is very tender but not falling off the bone.
              <br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, to make the Janssen's temptation, heat the oven to 200c/fan 180c/gas 6. Thinly slice the potatoes using a mandolin or a very sharp knife, then cut into matchsticks. Put in a bowl and cover with water until ready to use. Melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Add the anchovies, thyme and the white pepper and mix well. Drain the potatoes you've set aside, shaking off any excess water.
              <br>
              Put them in a large bowl and add the onion and anchovy mixture. Season well. Using very clean hands, combine gently so you don't break up the potato matchsticks. Tip into a buttered baking dish (about 30cm x 25 cm) and spread out evenly. Put the cream and milk in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Pour over the potato mixture and press it all down so that the top is as level as possible. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly over the top and bake for about 1 hour, or until the potato is tender. If the crumbs start to brown too much, cover with foil.
              <br>
              <br>
              When the lamb shanks are cooked transfer them to a large bowl with a slotted spoon, and cover to keep warms. Increase the heat and bring the sauce to the boil. Simmer until the sauce is reduced and slightly glazy, about 35-40 minutes. Return the shanks to the dish and turn them to get a good coating of the sauce. Serve with the Janssen's temptation and green veg - I like charred brussel sprouts and broccolini.
