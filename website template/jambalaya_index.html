          <h2 class="recipe-headings"> Chicken Jambalaya</h2>
            <p> This was the first dish I cooked from the first cookbook I was given by my mum. It's a Cajun dish that uses 'the holy trinity' of onion, garlic and celery with andouille sausage and chicken or shrimp. Andouille sausage can be tricky to get if you're not in the United States, so chorizo is a good substitute. Authentic Jambalaya calls for Cajun spices to be added during the process but chorizo has a some of the same herbs and spices added before curing. The quality of chorizo is crucial to the flavour of this dish. I use a semi-cured as the sausage stays more tender but fully cured is good as well - see <a href="#" id="produce-link">favourite produce</a> if you're in Sydney. It's a  great one-pot dish for beginners because you can do most of the prep in advance and then add the ingredients one at a time. My advice to beginners is to have lots of bowls with each of the ingredients in them based on when they get added.</p>

              <b>Wine Pairing - Logan Weemala Gewürtztraminer</b>
              <br>
              This doesn't have the overly sweet honey flavour that a lot of Gewürtztraminers have. It has a subtle melon flavours with well rounded aromatics that stand up to spice in the dish. It's also great value around the $20 mark.

              <h3 class="recipe-headings">Directions</h3>
              <p>Remove the outer skin on the chorizo, cut it into 1-2cm slices and add to a large, heavy-based saucepan over a medium-high heat. No need for oil in the pot yet - the sausage has enough oil in it to stop it from drying out. The aim is to get it to release its oils into the pot. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces, remove the chorizo from the pot and put in a large bowl on the side. Add one tbsp of grapeseed oil (or oil of choice), turn the temperature up slightly higher and add the chicken. You just want to brown the outside, not cook it through it should take 5 mins or so.
              <br>
              <br>
              While the chicken is cooking, peel and cut the onion into 1cm slices. Finely chop the chilli - you can de-seed if you prefer it a bit milder. I like mine quite spicy, so I usually leave the seeds and core in. Cut the celery into 1cm slices. Cut the capsicum into slightly larger pieces as it cooks quicker than the celery.
              <br>
              Put the tomatoes in a bowl and pour boiling water over them. Drain them after a minute, cut each of them in half, peel and roughly chop.
              <br>
              <br>
              When the chicken is browned on the outside, remove it from the saucepan and add it to the bowl with the chorizo. With the temperature still high, add the onions. The aim is to get them browned and very slightly charred around the edges, not sautéed.
              <br>
              While onions are on, heat the stock in a separate saucepan and add the Tobasco.
              <br>
              <br>
              When the onions look sufficiently browned, reduce the temperature slightly but not back to medium. Add the chicken and chorizo back in. Cook for two minutes or so, then add the chilli and crush the garlic cloves in. Make sure that the meat gets a good covering of garlic and chilli. After two minutes add the celery, capsicum and cook for five minutes so that they start to soften slightly.
              <br>
              <br>
              Add the rice to the saucepan, making sure that it gets a really good coating of the oil. Add the tomatoes, tomato purée and bay leaves, followed by the stock and give everything a good seasoning of black pepper. Chorizo and chicken stock have quite a bit of salt in them, so I don't add extra. Give the Jambalaya a good stir, bring to the boil, place the lid on, turn down and leave to simmer for 20 minutes.
              <br>
              If there's still a lot of liquid left in the pot, cook for 5 minutes with the lid off. Serve in bowls and garnish with finely chopped parsley and sliced spring onions.
